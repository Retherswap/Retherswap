# Retherswap Labs
Retherswap is a swap/dex for the Rethereum blockchain. The Retherswap Protocol is an open-source protocol for providing liquidity and trading ERC20 tokens on Rethereum. It eliminates trusted intermediaries and unnecessary forms of rent extraction, allowing for safe, accessible, and efficient exchange activity. The protocol is non-upgradable and designed to be censorship resistant.

The Retherswap Protocol and the Retherswap Interface were initially based around Uniswap V2 by Uniswap Labs. We've improved the product and made it our own.
- Easy Use
Retherswap got a easy to use interface for swapping your favorite tokens.
- No Limits
With the Rethereum blockchain, there is no limit how far Retherswap can go.
- Decentralized
Retherswap enables community ownership and active stewardship of the protocol.
- High Quality
The protocol is made of the highest quality of design.


## How do I use Retherswap?
To create a new liquidity pool, provide liquidity, swap tokens, or vote on governance proposals, head over to the Retherswap Interface and connect a Web3 wallet. Remember, each transaction on Rethereum costs Rether (RTH). For a more detailed walkthrough, check out our Help Guides.

If you’re a developer interested in building on top of the Retherswap Protocol, please refer to our extensive docs.


## How does Retherswap work?
Just like Uniswap - Retherswap is an automated market maker. In practical terms, it is a collection of smart contracts that define a standard way to create liquidity pools, provide liquidity, and swap assets.

Each liquidity pool contains two assets. The pools keep track of aggregate liquidity reserves and the pre-defined pricing strategies set by liquidity providers. Reserves and prices are updated automatically every time someone trades. There is no central order book, no third-party custody, and no private order matching engine.

Because reserves are automatically rebalanced after each trade, a Retherswap pool can always be used to buy or sell a token — unlike traditional exchanges, traders do not need to match with individual counterparties to complete a trade.


# Governance
## What is Governance?
The Rethereum Protocol is a public good owned and governed by RETHERS token holders.

Retherswap governance refers to the decentralized decision-making process within the Retherswap ecosystem, a prominent decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Rethereum blockchain. Retherswap allows users to swap various cryptocurrencies without relying on traditional intermediaries like centralized exchanges. Governance in the context of Retherswap involves key decisions about the protocol's development, parameters, and its future direction, all of which are determined by the community of Rethers token holders.


## The Retherswap Token
The Retherswap token enables community ownership and active stewardship of the Protocol. RETHERS holders govern the Protocol through an on-chain governance process. This approach aligns with the principles of decentralization and community-driven governance often seen in the blockchain and DeFi space.


## Community-led Growth
Having proven product-market fit for highly decentralized financial infrastructure with a platform that has thrived independently, Uniswap is now particularly well positioned for community-led growth, development, and self-sustainability. The introduction of RETHERS (ERC-20) serves this purpose, enabling shared community ownership and a vibrant, diverse, and dedicated governance system, which will actively guide the protocol towards the future.

Retherswap will always embraced the tenets of neutrality and trust minimization: it is crucial that governance is constrained to where it is strictly necessary. The Retherswap governance framework is limited to contributing to both protocol development and usage as well as development of the broader ecosystem.

In doing so, RETHERS officially enshrines Retherswap as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities.
